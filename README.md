# Free YouTube Video Downloader

YouTube Video Downloader is a GUI based application that is capable of downloading YouTube Videos by pasting the link of the video. Currently, there is no option to select a custom resolution, but I will keep updating and improving this application.

# How to run the Program?

1) Download the 'main.py' file or you can download the installer(.exe) from this website: https://mytechinstructor.wixsite.com/youtube/download

2) Run the 'main.py' file or run the application after installation.<br>[NOTE: If you want to run the 'main.py' file, then your computer must have python installed and also you will need to download the following packages:<br>a) Pytubefix: `pip install pytubefix`<br>b) Custom Tkinter: `pip install customtkinter`<br>*You can directly copy and paste the pip commands in Terminal.]

3) Paste a YouTube Video Link in the entry field and click on the Download button.

4) The download will then start and the progress bar will show the download progress.

5) Videos will be downloaded in 'C:\\YouTube Video Downloader\Downloads' folder which will automatically get created once you download the video.

6) You can directly open the folder by clicking on 'Show in Folder' Button.

7) I you want to download more videos than click on 'Reset' Button to reset the application.

8) You can also select the theme for the app by selecting a theme from the Dropdown Menu on the bottom right corner of the Application.
